Introduction
The Rubik's Cube solver is implemented in C++ and follows the principles of object-oriented programming. The code structure is designed to represent the various components of a Rubik's Cube, such as the cube itself, the faces, and the rotations. The solver uses the Layer-by-Layer method, which involves solving the cube layer by layer until completion.

Features
The Rubik's Cube solver offers the following features:

Object-Oriented Implementation: The code is organized using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it modular, extensible, and easy to understand. The various components of the Rubik's Cube, such as the cube itself, the faces, and the rotations, are represented using classes and objects.

Layer-by-Layer Method: The solver uses the popular Layer-by-Layer method to solve the Rubik's Cube. It solves one layer at a time, starting from the bottom layer and moving upwards until the entire cube is solved. This method simplifies the solving process and allows for an intuitive approach.

Scrambling Functionality: The solver provides a scramble() function that randomly scrambles the Rubik's Cube. This function shuffles the cube's faces and rotations to create a randomized starting configuration.

Solving Functionality: The solver includes a solve() function that solves the Rubik's Cube using the Layer-by-Layer method. This function applies the necessary rotations and algorithms to solve each layer until the entire cube is solved.

Print Cube State: The solver offers a printCube() function that prints the current state of the Rubik's Cube. This function displays the colors of each face and provides a visual representation of the cube's configuration.

Extensibility: The code is designed to be easily extensible. You can add additional functionality, algorithms, or strategies to improve the solver or experiment with different solving methods.
